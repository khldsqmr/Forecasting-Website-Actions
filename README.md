### __Project: Forecasting Website Actions__

---

> __Objective:__ The objective of this project is to develop a time series forecasting model that accurately predicts website floodlight actions. This involves utilizing input variables such as monthly dates, channel-specific spends, and retail product sales to optimize marketing strategies and enhance website performance. The aim is to improve decision-making processes and maximize the effectiveness of digital marketing efforts.

## Key Features
---
> This dataset is an imaginery dataset, which encompasses channel-specific spending, retail product sales, and website floodlight actions. Leveraging time series modeling, we aim to forecast these actions using monthly date, sales, and channel-specific spend data. This analysis enables data-driven insights for optimizing website performance and marketing strategies.
>
> - Utilizes time series modeling techniques for forecasting website floodlight actions.
> - Incorporates channel-specific spends and retail product sales as input variables.
> - Employs statistical tests like ADF and KPSS for data stationarity assessment.
> - Conducts seasonal decomposition analysis to identify underlying patterns.
> - Empowers data-driven decisions for optimizing marketing strategies and website performance.

## Key Steps

### __Step 1: Load the Modules__
> In this step, we import the libraries that will be used throughout the project. These libraries include pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for plotting, and various modules from statsmodels for time series analysis.

### __Step 2: Load Data__
> This step involves loading your dataset. In this project, the data is loaded from a CSV file named synthetic_data.csv. The dataset is parsed to interpret the 'Date' column as dates and set it as the index.

### __Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis__
> This is an optional step where you can explore the loaded dataset. Functions like data.head() and data.info() can be used to display the first few rows of the data and get an overview of its structure.

### __Step 4: Seasonal Decomposition__
> In this step, the time series data is decomposed into its constituent components: trend, seasonal, and residual. This decomposition helps identify underlying patterns and trends in the data.

### __Step 5: Stationarity Tests__
> Stationarity is a key assumption in time series modeling.
> - This step involves applying two different statistical tests, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (adf_test) and KPSS Test (kpss_test), to check if the data is stationary.
> - The results of these tests provide insights into the stationarity of the time series.

### __Step 6: Differencing for Stationarity__
> Differencing is a technique used to stabilize the mean of a time series. The apply_differencing function applies differencing to the data, while determine_differencing assesses whether differencing is needed based on the results of stationarity tests.

### __Step 7: ARIMA or SARIMA Model Selection__
> The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are generated to help choose between ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) models. The number of significant lags and cutoffs in these plots provide insights into the appropriate model choice.

### __Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search__
> Grid search is performed to find the best parameters for the ARIMA or SARIMA model. The grid_search_arima function uses an automated approach to explore various combinations of model parameters and selects the optimal configuration.

### __Step 9: Fitting the Model__
> The selected ARIMA or SARIMA model is fitted to the data using the fit_arima_or_sarima function. The model is trained to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the time series.

### __Step 10: Forecasting__
> Using the fitted model, future values of the time series are forecasted. The forecast_arima_or_sarima function returns the forecasted values along with lower and upper confidence intervals.

### __Step 11: Visualizing the Forecast__
> The forecasted values, along with confidence intervals, are plotted using the plot_forecast_with_ci function. This plot provides a visual representation of the forecasted values compared to the actual data, with confidence intervals indicating the range of uncertainty.

### __Step 12: Conclusion__
> In this notebook, we explored the process of forecasting website floodlight actions using time series modeling techniques. We began by loading and preparing the dataset, which contains channel-specific spends, sales data, and various floodlight actions.
